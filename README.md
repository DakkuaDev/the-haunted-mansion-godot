Warning!  ‚ö†Ô∏è

For some of us, it was our first Jam, and even more, it was the first time, we all used Godot Engine as an alternative to Unity, so this was really a motivation to try to learn this technology in a very short time. We encountered difficult challenges but overall was a rich experience. We hope you enjoy it!
